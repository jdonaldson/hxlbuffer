hxlbuffer - mutable string support to lua
=========================================

hxlbuffer is a C module for lua based on
[lbuffer from starwing](https://github.com/starwing/lbuffer),
it provides mutable string feature to the Lua language. It is not intended to
be used directly as a standard Lua library, since it relies on 0-indexed
arrays.
